    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Roasting the pumpkin brings out the sweetness, which pairs well with the salty pancetta. This "primo piatto," or first course, is simple and delicious!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups peeled, cubed pumpkin</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon fresh thyme</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>½ (16 ounce) package gemelli pasta</li>
        <li>1 (4 ounce) package diced pancetta</li>
        <li>1 cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>¼ cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Pile diced pumpkin on the baking sheet. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon olive oil and toss lightly to coat. Spread pumpkin out and sprinkle with thyme, salt, and pepper.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Remove and set aside.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of unsalted water to a boil. Add gemelli pasta and boil until just nearly tender, about 9 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat remaining olive oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add pancetta and cook until starting to brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the roasted pumpkin and cook, stirring frequently, 2 to 3 minutes more. Pour in chicken broth and bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Drain pasta and add to the pan with the pumpkin mixture. Continue cooking until pasta is tender yet firm to the bite, 1 to 2 minutes more. Serve immediately, topped with Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.</li>
